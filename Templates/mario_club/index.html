                <p>Super Mario[a] is a platform game series created by Nintendo, featuring their mascot, Mario. 
                    Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros.[b] series or simply the Mario[c] series, it is the 
                    central series of the greater 
                    Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. 
                    There have also been a number of Super Mario video games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms.[1] 
                    How many Super Mario games there are has been debated. 
                    There are currently twenty-one similar games and one cross-series 
                    game that may or may not be included as part of the series.</p>
